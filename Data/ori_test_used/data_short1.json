    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of delay constrained maximal information collection for CSMA-based wireless sensor networks. We study how to allocate the maximal allowable transmission delay at each node, such that the amount of information collected at the sink is maximized and the total delay for the data aggregation is within the given bound. We formulate the problem by using dynamic programming and propose an optimal algorithm for the optimal assignment of transmission attempts. Based on the analysis of the optimal solution, we propose a distributed greedy algorithm. It is shown to have a similar performance as the optimal one.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a method for detecting event trigger words in biomedical text based on a word sense disambiguation (WSD) approach. We first investigate the applicability of existing WSD techniques to trigger word disambiguation in the BioNLP 2009 shared task data, and find that we are able to outperform a traditional CRF-based approach for certain word-types. On the basis of this finding, we combine the WSD approach with the CRF, and obtain significant improvements over the standalone CRF, gaining particularly in recall.",

    "title": "composing architectural aspects based on style semantics",
    "abstract": "The lack of architecturally-significant mechanisms for aspectual composition might artificially hinder the specification of stable and reusable design aspects. Current aspect-oriented approaches at the architecture-level tend to mimic programming language join point models while overlooking mainstream architectural concepts such as styles and their semantics. Syntax-based pointcuts are typically used to select join points based on the names of architectural elements, exposing architecture descriptions to pointcut fragility and reusability problems. This paper presents style-based composition, a new flavor of aspect composition at the architectural level based on architectural styles. We propose style-based join point models and provide a pointcut language that supports the selection of join points based on style-constrained architectural models. Stability and reusability assessments of the proposed style-based composition model were carried out through three case studies involving different styles. The interplay of style-based pointcuts and some style composition techniques is also discussed.",

    "abstract": "We show how to connect the syntactic and the functional correspondence for normalisers and abstract machines implementing hybrid (or layered) reduction strategies, that is, strategies that depend on subsidiary sub-strategies. Many fundamental strategies in the literature are hybrid, in particular, many full-reducing strategies, and many full-reducing and complete strategies that deliver a fully reduced result when it exists. If we follow the standard program-transformation steps the abstract machines obtained for hybrids after the syntactic correspondence cannot be refunctionalised, and the junction with the functional correspondence is severed. However, a solution is possible based on establishing the shape invariant of well-formed continuation stacks. We illustrate the problem and the solution with the derivation of substitution-based normalisers for normal order, a hybrid, full-reducing, and complete strategy of the pure lambda calculus. The machine we obtain is a substitution-based, eval/apply, open-terms version of Pierre Crgut's full-reducing Krivine machine KN.",

    "abstract": "The emerging 4G (fourth generation) networks featuring wider coverage, higher transmission bandwidth and easier deployment have a desirable potential to serve ubiquitous and pervasive multimedia applications in creating new user-centric communication services. However, the practical implementation of 4G network to demonstrate such potential, especially for delivering real-time and high-quality video services, is scarce. This paper therefore provides the design and implementation of a future Internet live TV system over 4G networks to achieve cost-effectiveness, instead of using expensive satellite news gathering (SNG) vehicle and costly satellite transmissions in traditional TV stations. To effectively provide live TV services, we apply not only the hybrid duplex modes but also the port-based VLAN on the deployed networks for maximizing bandwidth, minimizing signal interference, and guaranteeing QoS of differentiated services. Performance metrics are applied to demonstrate that the proposed solution is cost-effective and is feasible for live TV services in future Internet.",

    "abstract": "In this paper we provide a systematic way to construct the robust counterpart of a nonlinear uncertain inequality that is concave in the uncertain parameters. We use convex analysis (support functions, conjugate functions, Fenchel duality) and conic duality in order to convert the robust counterpart into an explicit and computationally tractable set of constraints. It turns out that to do so one has to calculate the support function of the uncertainty set and the concave conjugate of the nonlinear constraint function. Conveniently, these two computations are completely independent. This approach has several advantages. First, it provides an easy structured way to construct the robust counterpart both for linear and nonlinear inequalities. Second, it shows that for new classes of uncertainty regions and for new classes of nonlinear optimization problems tractable counterparts can be derived. We also study some cases where the inequality is nonconcave in the uncertain parameters.",
