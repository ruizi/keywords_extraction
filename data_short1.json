    "abstract": "We investigate the problem of delay constrained maximal information collection for CSMA-based wireless sensor networks. We study how to allocate the maximal allowable transmission delay at each node, such that the amount of information collected at the sink is maximized and the total delay for the data aggregation is within the given bound. We formulate the problem by using dynamic programming and propose an optimal algorithm for the optimal assignment of transmission attempts. Based on the analysis of the optimal solution, we propose a distributed greedy algorithm. It is shown to have a similar performance as the optimal one.",

    "abstract": "This paper describes a method for detecting event trigger words in biomedical text based on a word sense disambiguation (WSD) approach. We first investigate the applicability of existing WSD techniques to trigger word disambiguation in the BioNLP 2009 shared task data, and find that we are able to outperform a traditional CRF-based approach for certain word-types. On the basis of this finding, we combine the WSD approach with the CRF, and obtain significant improvements over the standalone CRF, gaining particularly in recall.",

    "title": "composing architectural aspects based on style semantics",
    "abstract": "The lack of architecturally-significant mechanisms for aspectual composition might artificially hinder the specification of stable and reusable design aspects. Current aspect-oriented approaches at the architecture-level tend to mimic programming language join point models while overlooking mainstream architectural concepts such as styles and their semantics. Syntax-based pointcuts are typically used to select join points based on the names of architectural elements, exposing architecture descriptions to pointcut fragility and reusability problems. This paper presents style-based composition, a new flavor of aspect composition at the architectural level based on architectural styles. We propose style-based join point models and provide a pointcut language that supports the selection of join points based on style-constrained architectural models. Stability and reusability assessments of the proposed style-based composition model were carried out through three case studies involving different styles. The interplay of style-based pointcuts and some style composition techniques is also discussed.",

After presenting our motivation for undertaking this work, and its relevance to the growing interest in using tablet PC's in the classroom, we present an overview of our use of this technology to engage students during class. Finally, we present the students' reaction to the approach as measured through attitude surveys and a focus group.",

    "abstract": "We show how to connect the syntactic and the functional correspondence for normalisers and abstract machines implementing hybrid (or layered) reduction strategies, that is, strategies that depend on subsidiary sub-strategies. Many fundamental strategies in the literature are hybrid, in particular, many full-reducing strategies, and many full-reducing and complete strategies that deliver a fully reduced result when it exists. If we follow the standard program-transformation steps the abstract machines obtained for hybrids after the syntactic correspondence cannot be refunctionalised, and the junction with the functional correspondence is severed. However, a solution is possible based on establishing the shape invariant of well-formed continuation stacks. We illustrate the problem and the solution with the derivation of substitution-based normalisers for normal order, a hybrid, full-reducing, and complete strategy of the pure lambda calculus. The machine we obtain is a substitution-based, eval/apply, open-terms version of Pierre Crgut's full-reducing Krivine machine KN.",
